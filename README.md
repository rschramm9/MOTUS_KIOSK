# MOTUS_KIOSK
## Nature Center MOTUS Kiosk System

This project began as public display or "kiosk"" for a Motus receiver station for the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Ankeny Hill Nature Center. The goal is to engage public visitors to the site with a simple near-realtime display of current migratory bird tag detection events at the selected receiver. It presents a very simple limited number of screens that are easy to navigate. 

The project has evolved to become useful beyond that original site and has been now been deployed at other organizations as both a public 'on site' kiosk and as a public accessible www website.  The 'look' of the application (logos, colors, text content) is easily customizable.  

When deployed as a kiosk, the user interacts with the application via a touchscreen display.

When deployed as a web site, the touchscreen interface is replaced by the users web browser so it fully accessible via the World Wide Web.

The Motus Wildlife Tracking System (Motus) is an international collaborative research network that uses coordinated automated radio telemetry to facilitate research and education on the ecology and conservation of migratory animals. Motus is a program of Birds Canada in partnership with collaborating researchers and organizations. Learn more at https://motus.org

Below are some example screen captures.

### Hardware & Software Requirements

I have quite successfully built and run the application in full kiosk mode on low-end Intel NUC PC computers with Window 10 Pro or Windows 11 Pro pre-installed. These are easily purchased used on eBay for as little as $100.   Avoid any Windows 'Home Edition' versions. 

I have also built and run the application on Apple Mac OSX (but not as a locked down kiosk).

These are the machines I have used:

- NUC6CAY Celeron J3455 Processor 1.5Ghz 8GB Ram 120GB SSD w/wifi and Windows10 Pro (eBay $100) 
- NUC7i5BNH MiniPC QUadCore i5-78260U 8Gb w/128Gb SSD w/wifi and  Windows 11 Pro. (eBay $185)
- Apple Macbook Pro (circa 2018) 2.9 Ghz Intel core i9  32Gb w/macOS  12.6  (my development system)

The touchscreen I use is : Dell 24 Touchscreen Model P2424HT (Dell.com ~$300).
Also tested on a Viewsonic TD2760 which is a somewhat larger screen (27") at $480 new (found for much less on the used/ebay market)

USB Keyboard and Mouse

I *strongly* recommend Windows-11 PRO edition.  Home Edition works too but with some additional headaches getting set up.
