It’s rare to see birds in flight during migration. They typically fly high to elude predators
 and at night to keep from overheating. But we can track them, thanks to Motus towers. 
 Researchers can attach small nanotags to migrating birds, which send signals that are 
 detected by Motus towers, like the one on the north side of the Ankeny Hill Nature Center. 
 Tracking the movement patterns of migrating birds allows researchers to make informed 
 decisions about vulnerable species and their diverse habitats.
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p style="line-height:normal; font-size:12pt;">

One type of bird being tracked this way is the Swainson’s Thrush (SWTH). 
During this year’s fall migration, the Ankeny Motus tower detected nine SWTH traveling to their 
winter home in Central America. Seven of the nine had been tagged by Dr. Debbie Wheeler, 
biologist/entomologist at the University of the Fraser Valley in British Columbia. 
She uses information gathered from Motus to improve understanding of migration patterns and
 behavior of SWTH and further define their migratory path along the Pacific flyway.
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p style="line-height:normal; font-size:12pt;">

Dr. Wheeler says, <em>“The Motus data is starting to show some favoured migration routes
 - unfortunately we probably don’t have enough tags to draw any strong conclusions,
  but the results so far are interesting.”</em>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p style="line-height:normal; font-size:12pt;">
The success of Wheeler’s research is dependent upon the number of Motus towers on 
the SWTH flight path. And while the number has increased significantly in the last 5 years,
 she says, <em> “We just need more data from Motus stations further south. We have several 
 birds that appear to have settled in Mexico, but I suspect they have gone further south, 
 but there are fewer stations down there.”</em>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p style="line-height:normal; font-size:12pt;">
Knowing that the success of research is dependent on tracking towers, 
Vanessa Loverti, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regional shorebird biologist,
 has taken the lead in the placement of Motus towers in Oregon and Washington, 
 including the tower at Ankeny.
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p style="line-height:normal; font-size:12pt;">
She says,<em> “The cost of putting up a Motus tower is much more feasible for 
our partners and uses a collaborative research network for avian conservation,
 which provides valuable information like length-of-stay, timing of migration to
  the breeding ground, and data on unpredicted stopover sites.”</em>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p style="line-height:normal; font-size:12pt;">
It is clear that access to Motus technology and the data it generates greatly 
facilitates the researchers’ work. As more towers are built and more birds tagged, 
Motus will play an increasingly important role well into the future. 
The Ankeny tower will be part of that, and we will be curious to see if any of
 Dr. Wheeler’s birds pass the Ankeny tower when they return to their summer grounds
  during spring migration.
