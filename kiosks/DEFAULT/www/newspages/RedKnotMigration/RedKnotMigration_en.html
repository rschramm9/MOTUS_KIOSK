Red Knots, such as the one recently detected by the Motus receiver at Ankeny Hill
Nature Center, are migratory shorebirds that winter in South America and breed
in Alaska. Their migration route is challenging and one of the longest of any
shorebird. Their population is declining, and researchers want to know why.
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p style="line-height:normal; font-size:12pt;">

Red Knots rely on key stopover sites known to have favorable food and recovery
opportunities to sustain their trip. According to Dr. Paul Kerlinger, a leading expert
on bird migration, “Red Knots, Sanderlings, and other shorebirds make longer stopovers
where food resources are superabundant. It is not unusual for Red Knots to spend ten
days to two weeks at one location before continuing their journey.” <sup>1</sup>

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p style="line-height:normal; font-size:12pt;">

When birds reuse sites year after year, ecologists describe this as “site fidelity.”
This behavior is beneficial as long as conditions remain favorable for finding
reliable food and safety from predators. If the birds don’t adapt when the environment
changes, however, their population is likely to decline.


<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p style="line-height:normal; font-size:12pt;">

Researchers are concerned that may be the case for Red Knots at two key stopover
sites at Willapa Bay and Gray’s Harbor in Washington. The estuaries are being
threatened by invasive species and human disturbances that impact the ecosystem.
Climate change is also a suspected factor as rising sea levels cover the estuaries.

Motus tracking enables researchers to determine how long Red Knots are staying at
these sites and how their behavior is impacted by the changed environment.


<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p style="line-height:normal; font-size:12pt;">

This is where Vanessa Loverti comes in. She is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services
Shorebird Biologist working with the Pacific Region Migratory Birds and Habitat Program.
Her goal is to develop a network of Motus tracking stations along the Pacific Flyway
that can detect the miniature transmitters attached to shorebirds. This tracking system
creates a map of their migration. Knowing where they are stopping and how long they
stay allows researchers to identify critical habitats that Red Knots rely on. It also
helps researchers make more informed decisions regarding Red Knot survival and the
impact of climate change. The more towers, the more precise the mapping becomes and
Loverti’s project has already added seven towers to the network.
  

 
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p style="line-height:normal; font-size:12pt;">


During the recent installation of a tower in Newport, Loverti described the impact
of her project for Red Knots. “They’re shorebirds, and they’re tagging them with Motus
tags in Mexico … And then as they’re migrating up to Alaska to breed, they are marked
along the way, so we can get length of stay; how long they’re in the estuaries.
If climate change is happening and they’re not moving to their breeding ground, we know
that they’re staying close. There are all kinds of questions we can answer.”<sup>4</sup>
    

<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p style="line-height:normal; font-size:12pt;">


Loverti also coordinates the Pacific Flyway Shorebird Surveys each year. She said,
“Every time we do a study like this, we get to understand a little more about bird
habitat, migration patterns and genetics. We learn things that we never expected
to learn. I fully expect that we’ll be able to use the results of this work to further
conservation of both Red Knots and birds in general.”<sup>5</sup>



<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p style="line-height:normal; font-size:12pt;">


The conservation of migratory birds such as the Red Knot is too big of a task for a
single organization. The collaborative power of Motus allows scientists in the
Pacific Northwest to access the same data as our partners in Mexico. Thanks to
Loverti’s work, researchers have access to a broader range of data and will be in
a better position to help birds survive.
